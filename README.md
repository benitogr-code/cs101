## Computer Science 101

This project implements a small collection of data structures -with basic operations- and sorting algorithms.

* Use Cmake to create the build solution.
* Compile the executable.
* The executables runs all registered test (pass -? to get all command line options).

[Catch](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) test framework is used to unit test and show data structure usage.
